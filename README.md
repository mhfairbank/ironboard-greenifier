# Ironboard Greenifier

Ironboard Greenifier is a simple userscript for Flatiron School students who are irrationally annoyed that not all of their completed labs turn green on Ironboard. Or rationally annoyed because it makes it harder to tell what they have or haven't finished.

You supply a list of the labs that should rightly be green but aren't. Greenifier makes them green. It also changes the icon in the "Complete?" column from a no symbol to a check mark, and corrects the completed lab count.

Greenifier works on the Your Progress page only.
